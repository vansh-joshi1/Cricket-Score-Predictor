# Cricket Score Predictor

# Overview
The Cricket Score Predictor Web App uses machine learning to predict cricket scores. It demonstrates skills in data analysis, machine learning, and automation.

# Main Highlights
- Implemented automation for data collection and model deployment in the Cricket Score Predictor Web Application, highlighting automation skills.
- Achieved an R2 score of 0.98 and a minimal MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 2.11 by fine-tuning the XGBoost algorithm.

# Automation and Data Collection
A key feature of this project is the automated data collection. This ensures the model is always trained with the latest cricket data, improving prediction accuracy and reducing manual effort.

# Machine Learning Model
The Cricket Score Predictor uses an XGBoost machine learning model. Key features include:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming cricket data.
- **Model Tuning**: Optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Using R2 score and MAE to assess performance.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieving an R2 score of 0.98.
- **Precision**: Minimal Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 2.11.

# Web Application
The Cricket Score Predictor is available through an easy-to-use web app built with Streamlit. Users can enter match details, and the app delivers accurate score predictions using the trained model.
