# T20 Cricket Score Predictor

A machine learning-based web application that predicts the final score of a T20 cricket match based on current match statistics.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
1. A machine learning model trained on historical T20 International cricket data
2. A Streamlit web application that provides an intuitive interface for users to input match details and get score predictions

## Features

- Predict final scores for T20 cricket matches
- User-friendly interface with cricket-themed design
- Support for 10 international cricket teams
- Multiple cricket venues (35 cities) included
- Real-time prediction based on current match statistics

## Model Development

The prediction model was built using the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Used T20 International Dataset.csv containing historical T20 match data
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Selected relevant features (batting team, bowling team, city, current score, deliveries left, etc.)
   - Filtered data to include only cities with sufficient match history (>600 matches)
   - Shuffled data to ensure unbiased model training
3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Transformed categorical variables (teams, cities) using One-Hot Encoding
   - Standardized numerical features
4. **Model Training**:
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets
   - Used XGBoost Regressor with optimized hyperparameters
   - Achieved high accuracy with low mean absolute error
5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluated using R-squared score and Mean Absolute Error
   - Validated model performance on unseen data
